# 2A-Hashtable analysis

Unlike programming projects, this repo does not have any `tests` infrastructure.

The project prompt is a PDF file in the `./doc` directory.

## To Compile/Run
1. Copy your `hashtable.h` from the hash table programming project alongside this README.
2. `cmake . -B build` (on Windows native, use `cmake . -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles"`)
3. `cd build`
4. `make` (on Windows native, use `mingw32-make`) 
5. `./run-main`
